## Is this compatible with X other axolotl mod?

---
As of current observance, this mod is fully compatible with other axolotl mods such as [More Axolotl Variants Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/mavm)

## What do they do?

---
The tamed axolotls will follow their owner in the water and even teleport to their owner if there is an open water area to do so

## How do I tame them already???

---

Simply feed your little water critter tropical fish. It's that easy!
